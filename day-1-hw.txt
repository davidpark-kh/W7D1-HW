//   6,
//   6.666666666666667,

The List will be all positive numbers

let findAMax=[123,5436,45784,1234,34,65,234125,645,3452,13216,49]
//Expect
// 234125

Question #5

At the end of the third Iteration (the third time the loop has ran) of this for Loop define the state of all the variables used in the cell

var bingo = "B-I-N-G-O"
var ognib = ""
for(let i=bingo.length-1; i>=0; i--){
    ognib+=(bingo[i])
    //define state from this line on the third iteration
}
//bingo value is

//ognib value is

// i value is
